Items: 
	Having a random chance of making one of these items appear:
		Demondrug - Increasing attack with 5% for 2 minutes.
		Mega Demondrug - Increasing attack with 5% for 5 minutes.
		Might Pill - Increasing attack with 20% for 20 second.
	
	Each item will have its corresponding icon and will bounce around the screen for 10 second before disapearing.
	(Or each one has its own countdown for example: Demondrug stays for 20 second on screen and Might Pill stays for 5 seconds).
	
Hunters:
	4 Hunters can be added via the shop.
	You can choose 14 weapons but not have a hunter for every weapon (Or maybe you can we'll see how it works out).
	
	To add a hunter open the hunter menu via the shop and press the 'Add Hunter' button when you have enough Zenny.
	A new menu will be added in which you can manage your hunter (Increasing attack, Weapon Choice and more).

Monsters:
	New monsters will be added at certain tresholds.
	For example after 30 monsters a new group will be added to the monster pool.
	
	Instead of having to kill every monster you come across every monster has 2/3 minute (will most likely change) despawning period, meaning that you have 2/3 minutes to fight
	and kill the monster before despawning and being replaced by a slightly nerfed new monster.
	
	Elder Dragons:
		After a treshold of 250 monsters has been reached (will most likely change) elder dragons will enter the monster pool.
		Elder dragons will have a chance to spawn after every 10-20 monsters (again, will most likely change) instead of having a chance to spawn after every kill.
		
		Fatalis: 
			When a Elder Dragon is chosen there is a very slim chance for it to be Fatalis. When Fatalis has been chosen he will fade in while his theme starts playing at 50% mark his second phase
			theme starts playing.
			Fatalis will have massive health pool and take a long time to kill he will also have an extended despawning period.
